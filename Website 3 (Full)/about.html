                <h3>Meet Cryptic1526</h3>
                <p>Cryptic1526 is not just a username, it's a title. He's a superhero, an eutrepenuer, and a geniune git. He's always ready to save the day with his sharp wit and dashing good looks (or his overinflated ego).</p><span class="halfline"></span>
                <p>Cryptic1526 doesn't just make useless programs and apps like the one you're reading now, oh no. He crafts poetry. His lines of code are as eloquent as his speeches (so basicly really bad). He's the kind of developer who would say a joke like <em>"Why was the JavaScript reality show cancelled after only one episode? People thought it seemed scripted"</em>. Do you see anyone laughing? No didn't think so.</p><span class="halfline"></span>
                <p>But don't just take our word for it. Ask him yourself why he's the best developer in the world. We promise, he won't deny it, the pompous f*ck.<span class="halfline"></span>
